## Overview

SEO stands for **Search Engine Optimization**, which is the process of determining the main factors for ranking on search engine result pages (SERPs) and applying site changes based upon them to improve ranking. Put more simply, its the practice of changing a site to improve both the *amount of traffic* and the *quality of traffic* to your site *organically*.

To get a better understanding of what SEO truly is, we'll first explore how search engines work and then dig into how optimizing your ranking comes into play.

## How Search Engines Work

Search Engines are effectively living systems. Search Engines continually adjust in the background and also in reaction to user behavior. We will explore both the actions that happen behind the scenes and when a search query happens.

### In The Background

Search engines regularly crawl the internet and index webpages for future search queries. Let's take Google for instance. For Google, a set of web crawlers request web pages which are later converted into identifiers related to document metadata by an indexer. This indexer records information such as word occurrences called hits, the word position, and its font size. It then distributes this information in “barrels”, creating a partially sorted forward index.

### When A Search Happens

Generally, it's understood that a search engine takes in a query and returns back what it approximates are the best results for that query. There is much that happens behind the scenes when a user performs a search query, though. Usually, the search engine must first parse out the user’s query. Then, these words are converted into word identifiers. For each of these words, a document list is scanned for documents that match the search terms. Then, the search engine computes the rankings and returns a sorted list of the top k documents on a search engine result page[3]. The computation of these rankings changes greatly between search engines.

## Where SEO Comes In

To improve ranking, search engine optimizers focus upon factors both *on-site* and *off-site*. On-page factors correspond to direct site content while off-page factors relate to anything not on a given webpage.

In order to assist a web crawler in indexing content on a webpage, a webmaster must employ various white hat techniques and best practices. These may include properly structuring content, improving navigation, providing more quality content, or fitting quality content to a specific keyword scheme[6]. With regards to structure and navigation, providing relevant and meaningful <title>, <meta>, <nav>, and header tags can go a long way. Quality content speaks for itself, but can easily be enhanced by including descriptive links, including alt attributes for images, and serving content in a mobile optimized, secure manner.
